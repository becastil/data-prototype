└─ README.md                   # This file
```

Path aliases are defined to ease future refactors:
- `@components/*` → `app/components/*`
- `@utils/*` → `app/utils/*`
- `@styles/*` → `app/styles/*`

No runtime routes have been moved; this reorganization is non-breaking.

For a detailed explanation, see `docs/STRUCTURE.md`.

## Migration Plan (Non-breaking)

This restructure minimizes churn and preserves functionality.

- Documentation moved under `docs/` (no runtime impact)
- Path aliases added in `tsconfig.json` (backward-compatible)
- Duplicate parsing utilities consolidated via imports

Recommended next steps (optional and safe):
- Gradually group components under `app/components/{charts,loaders,accessibility,data}` and update imports to `@components/*` aliases. This can be done incrementally per PR without breaking routes.
- Consider introducing route groups (e.g., `app/(analytics)`) once features expand. Route groups do not change URLs.

### Archived/Relocated Files

Recommended relocations (to be applied):
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` → `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md`
- `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `compass_artifact_wf-*.md` → `docs/research/`
- `ideas/` assets → `docs/ideas/`

No functional files will be deleted; non-code artifacts should be archived under `docs/`.

- **Navigation Commands**: Quick access to Dashboard, Charts, and Data Table views
- **Data Management**: Export functions (CSV, JSON), data refresh, and filtering
- **Settings**: Theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts help
- **Search**: Type to fuzzy search through all available commands

#### Global Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Navigation**: `⌘H` (Dashboard), `⌘C` (Charts), `⌘T` (Data Table)
- **Data Export**: `⌘E` (CSV), `⌘⇧E` (JSON)
- **Workflow**: `⌘K` (Command Palette), `⌘F` (Focus Search), `⌘R` (Refresh)

### CSV Format Requirements

**Budget Data CSV** should include columns like:
- Month/Period
- Medical Claims, Rx, Admin Fees, Stop Loss Fees
- Budget/Target amounts
- Employee Count (for enrollment tracking)

**Claims Data CSV** should include columns like:
- Claimant Number
- Medical and Rx costs
- Service Type
- Total amounts

The system uses smart column detection to identify data regardless of exact column naming.

### Changing Theme Colors

```css
:root {
  --background: #FAF8F3;  /* Cream white background */
  --foreground: #2C2C2C;  /* Dark text */
}
```
