## Quick Start - Get Running in 5 Minutes âš¡

### For Windows Users (Easiest Method)

1. **Download and run our installer**:
   ```
   Copy and paste this into PowerShell (search for "PowerShell" in Start menu):
   ```
   ```powershell
   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

2. **Wait for everything to install automatically**
   - The installer will download everything you need
   - Just say "yes" when it asks permission

3. **Start the dashboard**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3005

**That's it!** You should see the dashboard ready to upload your files.

### Alternative Method (Any Computer)

If the quick installer doesn't work, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Node.js**
- Go to https://nodejs.org
- Download the "LTS" version (the green button)
- Install it like any other program
- Restart your computer

**Step 2: Download this project**
- Download as ZIP from GitHub, or
- If you know Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-prototype.git`

**Step 3: Open PowerShell/Terminal in the project folder**
- **Windows**: Right-click in the folder â†’ "Open in Terminal" or "Open PowerShell window here"
- **Mac**: Right-click in the folder â†’ "New Terminal at Folder"

**Step 4: Install and start**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Step 5: Open your browser** to http://localhost:3005

## Authentication & RBAC

The dashboard now requires authenticated access. Credentials are managed by [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) and are fully driven by environment variables so that no secrets are committed to the repository.

### Required environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | A 32+ character random string used to sign JSON Web Tokens. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `AUTH_USERS` | JSON array describing the allowed users. Each user includes an `id`, `email`, BCrypt `passwordHash`, `role`, and a list of RBAC `scopes`. |

Example `AUTH_USERS` value:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "admin-1",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "passwordHash": "$2a$10$EXAMPLEHASHFROMBCRYPT1234567890abcdefghi",
    "role": "admin",
    "scopes": ["phi:read", "phi:write"]
  }
]
```

Generate a password hash locally:

```bash
node -e "require('bcryptjs').hash('super-secret-password', 12).then(console.log)"
```

After the variables are configured, visit `/auth/signin` to log in. RBAC-protected API routes such as `/api/audit/logs` require the caller to include the appropriate scopes (for example, `phi:read`). Unauthorized requests are rejected with structured JSON error responses.
